# Intro ConnextRouter

## Who are routers?
- routers is backbone of connext network have a duty provide liquidity for user can use connext bridge tranfer token,data smooth & fast 
- routers will get network fees if connext network grow routers will benefit grow too.


## Why do we need them in Connext
- concept Trustlessness and Extensibility routers is key !
- in connext network routers very important 
have a duty provide liquidity but connext network need decentralization. 
- router is very important. increase of router is mean 
increase the decentralization on connext network in order to truly decentralize.


## security assumptions and risks
### assumptions & risk
- risk = not dispersed of validator node , smartcontract vulnerable 
risk not dispersed of validator node we can help connext network run routers for close the painpoint.

- assumptions = not dispersed of validator node attacker can attack the network

- Crosschain Bridge pain point of security is not dispersed of validator & intermediary confrim but connext network build incentive & community for disperse of routers.

## business model
- protocol revenue connext network is transaction frees.
### Who will use connext?
- Defi user change paltform & network depend on yield use connext for bridge cross network.
- NFT Collector want to buy other NFT on other chain use connext for bridge native token for buy NFT other chain.
